            "2. Core Components of Photosynthesis:\n",
            "- Light-dependent reactions: Occur in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts and involve capturing light energy to produce ATP and NADPH.\n",
            "- Light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle): Take place in the stroma of chloroplasts and involve using ATP and NADPH to convert carbon dioxide into glucose.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. Detailed Explanation:\n",
            "a. Light-dependent reactions:\n",
            "- Light energy is absorbed by chlorophyll in the thylakoid membranes.\n",
            "- This energy is used to split water molecules into oxygen, protons, and electrons.\n",

            "Question Type: Explanation\n",
            "\n",
            "Answer: 1. Key Terms:\n",
            "- Quantum Entanglement: A phenomenon in quantum physics where two or more particles become interconnected in such a way that the quantum state of each particle cannot be described independently of the others, even when separated by large distances.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. Core Components:\n",
            "- Superposition: A quantum property in which a particle can exist in multiple states simultaneously until measured.\n",
            "- Quantum States: Descriptions of a system in terms of its properties such as position, momentum, spin, etc.\n",
            "- Measurement: The act of determining a particle's properties, which collapses its wavefunction and forces it to take on a definite state.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. Explanation:\n",
            "- Quantum entanglement occurs when two or more particles become correlated in such a way that their quantum states are interdependent. This means that the properties of one particle are directly related to the properties of the other(s), regardless of the distance between them.\n",
            "- When particles become entangled, their quantum states are no longer independent but are connected through a shared wavefunction. This connection persists even if the entangled particles are separated by vast distances.\n",
            "- Entangled particles exhibit a strong correlation, where measuring the state of one particle instantaneously determines the state of the other particle, regardless of the distance between them. This phenomenon occurs faster than the speed of light, defying classical notions of causality.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. Example:\n",
            "- Imagine two entangled particles, A and B, whose spins are entangled in a way that if particle A is measured to have an \"up\" spin, particle B will always be measured to have a \"down\" spin, and vice versa. This correlation remains even if the particles are light-years apart.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. Significance:\n",
            "- Quantum entanglement is a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics with profound implications for the nature of reality and the potential for future technologies such as quantum computing and quantum communication.\n",
            "- Understanding and harnessing quantum entanglement has the potential to revolutionize fields such as cryptography, teleportation, and supercomputing by exploiting the unique properties of entangled particles.\n",
            "- Quantum entanglement challenges our classical intuitions about the nature of reality, highlighting the non-local and interconnected nature of the quantum world.\n",
